# stayz-emulation-no-js
Emulation challenge of Stayz.com.au interface based off mockup picture. No JavaScript was used to achieve results.

NB: This was an initial challenge set to me by Stayz for a potential role. After completing the challenge, various circumstances led me to turn this role down (No offence to Stayz, wonderful company). I am still quite happy with what I was able to do to emulate the result.
